# Overview

This repo is a collection of tools and processes used during development of embedded software at Airware.  Since Airware is no longer continuing with embedded software development and the IP in this repo is not something we seek to protect, we are opening up these embedded tools as open source.

Notes:

* Use of this repo is governed by the license in the root of this repo.
* While use of this repo is governed by an Open Source license, the repo shall remain private because Airware can not maintain these projects as official open source.
